# Hamlet Environment Variables (Local Development)
# Copy this file to .env and modify as needed

# Override the active app for local development
# HAMLET_APP=my-playground

# This will make hamlet-cli target app/my-playground instead of app/horatio
# Useful for testing multiple example apps without committing changes
