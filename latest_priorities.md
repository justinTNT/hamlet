# Hamlet Framework Roadmap 2.0 - Revised

## Vision
Hamlet provides **type-safe client-server boundaries** with **web-native capabilities** for modern PWA development. Focus on eliminating JSON codec drudgery while enabling mobile-like experiences through standard web APIs.

## Current State
- ✅ **Core Framework**: Rust→Elm type generation working
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Automatic migrations, tenant isolation
- ✅ **Middleware Stack**: KV store, sessions with tenant isolation  
- ✅ **Demo Application**: Horatio microblog proves the concept
- ✅ **Background Events**: Basic event queue with retry/DLQ in Horatio (see `notes/background_event_queue.md` - half-implemented)
- ✅ **Session Management**: HTTP session cookies replacing fingerprinting
- ✅ **SSE Infrastructure**: Basic server-sent events (half-implemented)

## Event Store Foundation

**Configuration-driven capabilities:**

### With Database + Event Store Enabled
```rust
[hamlet.features]
database = true
event_store = true  // Adds ES tables to existing database
```

**Full Capabilities:**
- ✅ **Multi-stage workflows** - Chain operations reliably
- ✅ **Persistent delayed/scheduled events** - Survive restarts
- ✅ **Reliable service calls** - Retry logic, delivery guarantees  
- ✅ **Workflow status/history** - Track progress, audit trail
- ✅ **Failed event recovery** - Dead letter queue, retry operations
- ✅ **Correlation tracking** - Trace related events

### Without Database OR Event Store Disabled
```rust
[hamlet.features]
database = false  // OR event_store = false
```

**Best-Effort Capabilities:**
- ❌ **Multi-stage workflows** - Not available
- ✅ **Volatile delayed events** - setTimeout/setInterval (lost on restart)
- ✅ **Fire-and-forget service calls** - HTTP requests (no retries)
- ❌ **Status/history/recovery/correlation** - Not available

## Major Components (Latest Priorities)

### 🎯 **Phase 1: Complete Event System (Immediate - 4-6 weeks)**

TODO: wire up session_id to event store


**Dependencies**: Builds on existing Horatio event infrastructure  
**Deliverables**:
- Event store schema update (add session_id column)  
- Enhanced SSE with session-based targeting

---

### 🔗 **Phase 1.5: WebSocket Implementation (2-3 weeks)**

Client↔client messaging with server-mediated routing.

```rust
// Type-safe client messaging
#[derive(BuildAmpWebSocket, Debug, Clone)]
pub enum GameMessage {
    PlayerMove { game_id: String, x: i32, y: i32 },
    ChatMessage { text: String },
    GameState { board: Vec<Vec<i32>> },
}
```

**Generated Elm interface:**
- Always-available send functions: `sendGameMove` (A<==>B), `sendChatMessage` (broadcast)
- Optional subscriptions: `onGameMove`, `onChatMessage` 
- Server-controlled connections: `onWebSocketConnect`, `onWebSocketDisconnect`
- No room abstractions - server handles routing via Elm business logic

**Dependencies**: Event system (for connection orchestration)
**Deliverables**:
- Type-safe WebSocket message generation
- Server-mediated connection management  
- Client state awareness interface

### 📁 **Phase 2: File Upload Types (4-6 weeks)**

Essential for real applications. Web-native file handling with event integration.

#### 2.1 Type-Safe File Upload
```rust
#[derive(BuildAmpFileUpload, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct PhotoUploadReq {
    pub album_id: String,
    pub caption: Option<String>,
    pub constraints: FileConstraints,
}

#[derive(BuildAmpElm, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct FileConstraints {
    pub max_size_mb: u32,
    pub allowed_types: Vec<String>,
    pub image_max_dimensions: Option<(u32, u32)>,
}
```

#### 2.2 Event Integration
**With Event Store**: Upload → immediate response → background processing workflow
**Without Event Store**: Upload → synchronous processing

#### 2.3 Storage Abstraction
- Local filesystem for development
- S3/CloudFlare R2 for production
- Generated upload handling and serving

**Dependencies**: Event system (for background processing)
**Deliverables**: 
- Generated multipart form handling
- File constraint validation
- Storage backend abstraction
- Event-driven processing workflows

---

### ⚙️ **Phase 4: Background Workers (6-8 weeks)**

Type-safe worker communication for CPU-intensive tasks.

#### 4.1 Worker Communication Types
```rust
#[derive(BuildAmpWorker, Debug, Clone)]  
pub enum ImageWorker {
    ProcessImage { image_data: Vec<u8>, width: u32 },
    ProcessingProgress { percent: f32 },
    ProcessingComplete { result_url: String },
    ProcessingFailed { error: String },
}
```

#### 4.2 Generated Worker Infrastructure
- Type-safe postMessage handling
- Worker lifecycle management
- Integration with event system (workers can trigger events)

**Dependencies**: Event system (for worker→event integration)
**Deliverables**:
- Generated worker communication
- Background task processing
- Event system integration

---

### 📚 **Phase 5: Developer Experience (Ongoing/Parallel)**

Enhanced tooling and documentation.

- Generate documentation for all middleware endpoints
- Interactive Swagger UI for testing
- Type-safe client SDK generation
- Complete API documentation
- Integration guides
- Best practices
- Reference applications


---

## Architecture Principles

1. **Type-Safe Boundaries First**: All communication defined in Rust, generated for Elm
2. **Event-Driven Foundation**: Multi-stage workflows and reliable integrations via event store
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Apps work without event store, get enhanced capabilities with it
4. **Web-Native**: Standard web APIs, not native app emulation
5. **Configuration-Driven**: Features enabled/disabled via build configuration
6. **Small App Focused**: Perfect for solo developers and small teams
